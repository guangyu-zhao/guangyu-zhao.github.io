Actually this internship started on May 10th and ended on August 19th. But considering the website is created after the day I checked out, I record this period of memory later.

<h2>Check in<h2>

At first, I noticed Microsoft's job advertisement in a WeChat group, so I tried grabbing this opportunity. I had no prior experience in Java development at that time, but I was confident in learning Java by myself in a short period because I thought I had been an expert in C++ and it resembles Java in many aspects. My view was not accurate at all, but this work didn't require many advanced features of Java.

Then the remote interview was conducted two weeks later. This interview included an algorithm problem, but using Python was allowed and the problem wasn't difficult, and what's more, the result was judged subjectively (by the interviewer, who later became my mentor). So I checked in on May 10th successfully. Considering the heavy schoolwork pressure, I hadn't worked on-site until July 13th.

I had been living close to Microsoft Asia Pacific R&D Group Headquarters Building for approximately 14 years but had never stepped into the building before. Leave work aside, there were various kinds of food in canteens and the dishes were much cheaper than what was in a common restaurant nearby. Pantries were set up in the hallway and anyone in the company can get food and drink there. What impressed me the most was that there were sleeping capsules offered for a nap at noon. So considerate the company was that I fell in love with it on the first day.


<h2>Working</h2>

Each intern had a workstation of about one square meter with two computer monitors. Two monitors were useful, I can see the front-end on one and the back-end on the other. In my work, the knowledge about Java involved wasn't so difficult, but sometimes something unrelated to coding could be so tricky that I didn't even know if it could be done. Then I needed to read information and try to explore what I could do.

I used to doubt my ability to read information and solve problems independently. But this Minecraft development program gave me the confidence to do these since I finally finished something tricky all by myself, though time-consuming.

The result of my program is shown below. Even though this is definitely not the final version, I gained a sense of accomplishment from this program.

<h2>Entertaining</h2>

It was said in Microsoft that "Work hard, play harder". I enjoyed quality entertaining time in MSRA and luckily encountered friends here. We shared common hobbies such as board games,  frisbee, and Texas Poker. Besides, the themes of our communication went beyond our hobbies, such as research and personal growth experience. We went from strangers to acquaintances in games and went from acquaintances to friends in further communication during our internship.

Microsoft also offered opportunities to socialize and enjoy ourselves. I went through one crazy Friday party during the one-month on-site internship. I went through two concerts during the one-month on-site internship. I went through three tech talks during the one-month on-site internship.

On the day I checked out, I was enveloped by reluctance. But fortunately, I still have contact with some friends after leaving the company. This picture was taken with two of my friends, hoping our friendship could last longer.
